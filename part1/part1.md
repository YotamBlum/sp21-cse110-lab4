Part 1a.
1. values added: 20
2. final result: 20
3. values added: 20
4. error: result is not defined in this scope
5. values added: 0
6. error: result is not defined in this scope
Part 1b.
1. 3 because this is the final value of i after 3 iterations
2. 150 because this is the value of prices[2] (300) * (1-discount (0.5))
3. 150 because this is the value of Math.round(discountedPrice (150) * 100)/100
4. An array containing [50, 100, 150] since each final price is just the discount price multiplied by 100 then divided by 100
5. error: i does not exist in this scope
6. error: discountedPrice does not exist in this scope
7. 150 because this is the value of Math.round(discountedPrice (150) * 100)/100
8. An array containing [50, 100, 150] since each final price is just the discount price multiplied by 100 then divided by 100
9. error: i does not exist in this scope
10. 3 because this was the value of prices.length when it was assigned
11. an empty array because consts cannot be modified
12A. student.name
12B. student['Grad Year']
12C. student.greeting()
12D. student['Favorite Teacher'].name
12E. student.courseLoad[0]
13A. '32' because the + is interpreted as the concatenation operator
13B. 1 because the - is interpreted as subtraction
13C. 3 because the null is interpreted as a 0
13D. '3null' because the null is interpreted as 'null'
13E. 4 because the true is interpreted as a 1
13F. 0 because both the false and null are interpreted as 0
13G. '3undefined' because the undefined is interpreted as 'undefined'
13H. NaN because neither type is subtractable
14A. true because the '2' is loosely interpreted as a 2
14B. false because the ASCII values are compared
14C. true because the '2' is loosely interpreted as a 2
14D. false because the types are compared along with values
14E. false because true is interpreted as a 1
14F. true because the Boolean(2) returns true
15. == only considers value while === also considers type
17. [2,4,6] because each number in the original array is doubled by the doSomething function
19. 1 4 3 2
